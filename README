General Structure: 
We have a class, Network, which contains a Double Linked List of People. 
We have a class, Person, which stores data about a person. 
The data stored is the person's first and last name, their email, phone number and birthdate. 
Additionally, in person, two pointers are stored: one pointing to the previous person in the linked list and the other to the next person in the linked list. 
The email and phone number classes are both children of a parent class, Contact and aggregates of Person.
The birthdate stored in person is also a class and is an aggregate of Person.
